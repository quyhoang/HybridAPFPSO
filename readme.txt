This version was last tested on 16/9/2015
In this version we deploy MRS to detect light source by applying PSO and APF.

All matlab files in this folder are functions. 
For details of each function, please use matlab "help" command.

Main functions are HBPSO_connect and HBPSO 
(with and without evaluation of connectivity).

To run any of these two functions, please:
1. Set parameters (modify initialize.txt)
2. Provide a valid argument for the function. 
For example: 
>> HBPSO('singleLuna')
